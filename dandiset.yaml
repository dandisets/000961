description: 'This dataset includes electrophysiological and optical recordings across
  six mice. Simultaneous recordings were obtained through the use of a flexible, insertable
  and transparent microelectrode array (Neuro-FITM), ranging from 16 to 32 channels.
  Electrophysiology recordings were obtained from deep cortical layers and subcortical
  structures. Optical recordings were obtained via wide-field calcium imaging across
  the dorsal cortex. This data was obtained through a collaboration between Takaki
  Komiyama and Duygu Kuzum at the University of California, San Diego and is featured
  in the following paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00841-5.'
